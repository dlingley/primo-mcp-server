"""Single source of truth for caller-facing search policy prose.

The scope-selection policy and the zero-result retry guidance are shown to
callers in three places: the MCP server instructions, the primo_search tool
description, and the zero-result output of format_search_results. All three
are composed from the line lists here so the copies cannot drift. README.md
and AGENTS.md mirror this policy for human readers; edit them together.

Args:
    query: Search terms (e.g. "machine learning entrepreneurship").
    field: Search field -- "any" (default), "title", "creator", "sub" (subject), "isbn", "issn", "oclcnum".
    scope: "everything" for local catalogue + subscribed databases, "catalogue" for local only, "books_videos" for the books/videos scope.
    sort_by: "rank" (relevance, default), "date" (newest first), "title" (alphabetical).
    limit: Number of results to return (1-50, default 10).
    offset: Pagination offset (default 0). Use to get the next page of results.
    resource_type: Filter by type -- "books", "articles", "journals", "databases", "videos", "dissertations", "conference_proceedings".
    date_from: Start year filter (YYYY format, e.g. "2020").
    date_to: End year filter (YYYY format, e.g. "2025").
    peer_reviewed: Set to true to show only peer-reviewed items.
    include_unavailable: Set to true to also include article-index (CDI)
        records the library has NO full text access to (Primo's "expanded"
        search). Default (false) restricts results to accessible material,
        which is what holdings and access confirmation requires. Only set
        true when the user explicitly wants to discover material beyond the
        library's collection, e.g. for interlibrary loan or comprehensive
        literature mapping.
    online: Set to true to show only online resources.
    facet_filters: Optional facet refinements as a {facet: value} object,
        e.g. {"topic": "Economics", "lang": "eng"}. Use facet names and
        values exactly as reported in the "Result landscape" section of a
        previous search. Common facets: rtype, topic, creator, jtitle,
        lang, tlevel, library.
    facet_exclusions: Like facet_filters, but removes matching results
        (e.g. {"rtype": "reviews"} to drop book reviews).
    clauses: Optional compound boolean query. Each clause has a value,
        optional field (any, title, creator, sub, isbn, issn, oclcnum),
        optional operator (contains, exact, begins_with), and optional
        connector (AND, OR, NOT) joining it to the NEXT clause. Use for
        precision needs a single query string cannot express: known-item
        lookups (title AND creator), exact-title subscription checks
        (title exact), or genuine OR expansion across synonyms. When
        given, clauses replace query/field as the retrieval query; still
        set query to a short plain-text summary of the intent for display.

Returns:
    Formatted search results with title, authors, year, identifiers,
    availability, shelf locations and access links where known, and a
    "Result landscape" facet summary when Primo serves facets.
